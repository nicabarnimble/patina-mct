Create an explicit new Patina session boundary with Git tagging:

1. Execute the bundled session-new wrapper:
   `.pi/bin/session-new.sh "$ARGUMENTS"`

2. Read the returned JSON and use `artifact_path` to open the new durable session artifact in `layer/sessions/`.

3. If `last_session_path` exists, read it. It points to the previous session artifact. You MUST read the full session file referenced there to understand what actually happened. Then fill in the "Previous Session Context" section with a substantive 2-3 sentence summary. Don't write generic fluff — include specific accomplishments, key fixes, and open items.

4. If we've been discussing work already in this conversation:
   - Update the Goals section with specific tasks we've identified
   - Add context about why this new boundary was started
   - Note any decisions or constraints we've discussed

5. Ask the user: "Would you like me to create todos for '$ARGUMENTS'?"

6. Remind the user about session workflow:
   - Use `/session-update` periodically to capture progress
   - Use `/session-note` for important insights
   - Use `/session-end` to archive, classify work, and tag the session range
   - Use `spec.next`, `spec.show`, and `spec.check` when spec workflow is relevant

The session is now tracking code changes and Git history. Mother owns the session lifecycle.
